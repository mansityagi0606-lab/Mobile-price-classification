# Machine Learning Model Deployment using AWS SageMaker

This project demonstrates end-to-end deployment of a machine learning model
using Amazon SageMaker.

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and model training using Scikit-learn
2. Cloud-based training using SageMaker Estimator
3. Model artifact storage in Amazon S3
4. Deployment as a real-time inference endpoint
5. Prediction on unseen data

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Amazon SageMaker
- AWS S3

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with cloud ML deployment
- Understanding of real-time inference endpoints
- Managing ML infrastructure using AWS
